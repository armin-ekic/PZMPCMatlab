This project contains the main files used for the matlab implementation of the PZMPC problem. This is currently a work in progress, and when completed and simulated correctly, this code will be used as the base to create an implementation using C.

The paper referenced for this project is "Periodic-Zone  Model  Predictive  Control  for  Diurnal  Closed-Loop  Operation of an Artificial Pancreas" written by Ravi  Gondhalekar,  Ph.D.,  Eyal  Dassau,  Ph.D.,  Howard  C.  Zisser,  M.D.,  and  Francis  J.  Doyle  III,  Ph.D.
